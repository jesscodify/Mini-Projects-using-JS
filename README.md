# Mini-Projects-using-JS

This repository contains a collection of mini projects implemented using JavaScript. Each project focuses on a specific task and demonstrates the usage of JavaScript in different scenarios.

#  1: Check Eligibility to Vote![screencapture-file-G-Coding-Bootcamp-JS-DAY2-practice-Eligibiltity-checker-index-html-2023-07-14-16_51_55](https://github.com/jesscodify/Mini-Projects-using-JS/assets/93216297/7b502869-a3f7-442d-ab5d-74b618903309)

This project implements a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter their age. The program then checks if the entered age is greater than or equal to 18. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, it displays a message stating "You are eligible to vote." Otherwise, it displays a message stating "You are not eligible to vote yet."

 # 2: Print the Table of a Number![screencapture-file-G-Coding-Bootcamp-JS-DAY2-practice-Table-index-html-2023-07-14-16_52_45](https://github.com/jesscodify/Mini-Projects-using-JS/assets/93216297/c54c1ce9-54ef-483f-b00c-b1c3b5efaeea)

The second project is a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter a number. The program then generates and displays the table of that number from 1 to 10. Each line of the table displays the multiplication of the entered number with the respective multiplier (from 1 to 10).

# 3: Convert Dollars to Rupees![screencapture-file-G-Coding-Bootcamp-JS-DAY2-practice-Convert-Dollars-to-Rupees-index-html-2023-07-14-16_52_35](https://github.com/jesscodify/Mini-Projects-using-JS/assets/93216297/b0d8cc0f-4e0b-4ff3-a174-7d1ed78e49e1)

In the third project, a JavaScript program prompts the user to enter an amount in dollars. The program then converts the entered dollar amount to Indian Rupees using the conversion rate of 1 dollar = 82.16 rupees. Finally, it displays the converted amount to the user.
